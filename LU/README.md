# LU Factorization Algorithm
## By: Justyn Knapp

#### INPUTS: A (a matrix containing the coefficients of a system of equations)
#### OUTPUTS: L (a lower triangle matrix, this contatins the coefficients used in order to eliminate variables). U (an upper triangle matrix which will show how the matrix has been modified using the coefficients of L). P (a pivot matrix that when multiplied by A will be equal to L times U)

#### Purpose: The purpose of this algorithm is to find the L, U, and P matrix of a matrix A. This algorithm will work for any square matrix of any dimension. The end matrixes can be used to then solve a system of equations if the algorithm is edited further.
