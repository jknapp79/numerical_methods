# Simpson Method Algorithm
## BY: Justyn Knapp

###   INPUTS: X (a set of x points) Y (a set of y points)
###   OUTPUTS: I (integral using the 1/3 Simpson's Method)
### NOTE: If there is an odd number of segments the trapezoid rule will be used on the last increment.

### Purpose: This algorithis is deisgned to approximate the integral over a set of tabulated data. The data must be equally space between points, and there must be a y value for every x value. This is designed as an approximation of an integral and will get more and more accurate depending on how small the step size is.
